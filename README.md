# elixir-test

Test task for Elixir developers. Candidate should write a simple banking OTP application in Elixir language.

### General acceptance criteria

- All code is in `git` repo (candidate can use his/her own github account).
- OTP application is a standard `mix` project.
- Application name is `:ex_banking` (main Elixir module is `ExBanking`).
- Application interface is just set of public functions of `ExBanking` module (no API endpoint, no REST / SOAP API, no TCP / UDP sockets, no any external network interface).
- Application should `not` use any database / disc storage. All needed data should be stored only in application memory.
- Candidate can use any Elixir or Erlang library he/she wants to (but app can be written in pure Elixir / Erlang / OTP).
- Solution will be tested using our auto-tests for this task. So, please follow specifications accurately.
- Public functions of `ExBanking` module described in this document is `the only one` thing tested by our auto-tests. If anything else needs to be called for normal application functioning then probably tests will fail.
- Code accuracy also matters. Readable, safe, refactorable code is a plus.

### Money amounts

- Money amount of any currency should `not` be negative.
- Application should provide `2 decimal` precision of money amount for any currency.
- Amount of money incoming to the system should be equal to amount of money inside the system + amount of withdraws (money should not appear or disappear accidentally).
- User and currency type is any string. Case sensitive. New currencies / users can be added dynamically in runtime. In the application, there should be a special public function (described below) for creating users. Currencies should be created automatically (if needed).

### API reference

Requirements for public functions provided by `ExBanking` module. Any function should return success result or error result.

*@spec create_user(user :: String.t) :: :ok | {:error, :wrong_arguments | :user_already_exists}*

- Function creates new user in the system
- New user has zero balance of any currency

*@spec deposit(user :: String.t, amount :: number, currency :: String.t) :: {:ok, new_balance :: number} | {:error, :wrong_arguments | :user_does_not_exist | :too_many_requests_to_user}*

- Increases user's balance in given `currency` by `amount` value
- Returns `new_balance` of the user in given format

*@spec withdraw(user :: String.t, amount :: number, currency :: String.t) :: {:ok, new_balance :: number} | {:error, :wrong_arguments | :user_does_not_exist | :not_enough_money | :too_many_requests_to_user}*

- Decreases user's balance in given `currency` by `amount` value
- Returns `new_balance` of the user in given format

*@spec get_balance(user :: String.t, currency :: String.t) :: {:ok, balance :: number} | {:error, :wrong_arguments | :user_does_not_exist | :too_many_requests_to_user}*

- Returns `balance` of the user in given format

*@spec send(from_user :: String.t, to_user :: String.t, amount :: number, currency :: String.t) :: {:ok, from_user_balance :: number, to_user_balance :: number} | {:error, :wrong_arguments | :user_does_not_exist | :not_enough_money | :sender_does_not_exist | :receiver_does_not_exist | :too_many_requests_to_sender | :too_many_requests_to_receiver}*

- Decreases `from_user`'s balance in given `currency` by `amount` value
- Increases `to_user`'s balance in given `currency` by `amount` value
- Returns `balance` of `from_user` and `to_user` in given format

### Performance

- In every single moment of time the system should handle 10 or less operations for every individual user (user is a string passed as the first argument to API functions). If there is any new operation for this user and he/she still has 10 operations in pending state - new operation for this user should immediately return `too_many_requests_to_user` error until number of requests for this user decreases < 10
- The system should be able to handle requests for different users in the same moment of time
- Requests for user A should not affect to performance of requests to user B (maybe except `send` function when both A and B users are involved in the request)
